# Python_Data-Wrangling-Project

You have two sample datasets attached to this test:
- price.csv: records of product's history price changes in Sep 2018
- sales.csv: records of product's sales in Sep 2018

  Use any wrangling tools to calculate the total revenue of each product at each price. The solution must be applicable to similar datasets with large numbers of records.
